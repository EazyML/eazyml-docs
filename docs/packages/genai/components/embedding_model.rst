Embedding Model
---------------
It is used to converts text, images, or other types of data into
high-dimensional numerical vectors. These embeddings capture the
semantic meaning of the data and are often used in tasks like search,
clustering, recommendation systems, and similarity comparison in
machine learning and AI applications.
